<P ALIGN=center><H3>The Invisible Killer</H3>
<P>
Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of
people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but
the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form
causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating
and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte
imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain
death.

<B><I>Dihydrogen monoxide:</i></b>

<ul>
<li>is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.
</li>
<li>contributes to the "greenhouse effect."
</li>
<li>may cause severe burns.
</li>
<li>contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.
</li>
<li>accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.
</li>
<li>may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.

</ul>

<P ALIGN=center><B><I>Contamination Is Reaching Epidemic Proportions!</I></B></p>
<P>
Quantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake, and
reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the contaminant has even been
found in Antarctic ice. DHMO has caused millions of dollars of property damage in the
midwest, and recently California.
<P>
Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:

<ul>
<li>as an industrial solvent and coolant.
</li>
<li>in nuclear power plants.
</li>
<li>in the production of styrofoam.
</li>
<li>as a fire retardant.
</li>
<li>in many forms of cruel animal research.
</li>
<li>in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by
this chemical.
</li>
<li>as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products.
</li>
</ul>

Companies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to stop
them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot
afford to ignore it any longer!
<P>
<P ALIGN=center><I><B>The Horror Must Be Stopped!</B></I></p>
<P>
The American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this
damaging chemical due to its "importance to the economic health of this nation." In fact, the
navy and other military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and
designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare situations.
Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated
underground distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use.
